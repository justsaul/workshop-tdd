## Task definition

Implement counter component.

From UI perspecrive user sees 2 buttons - one that increments, other that decrements the counter.
When user presses on button he should see counter (displayed as text) increase

### Bonus task #1

If count is divisible by 2, increment button should have blue colour, otherwise, it should have red colour.

### Bonus task #2

If user pressed 5 times on increment button (without pressing decrement button). User should see prompt - asking him if he truly wish to proceed with such action.

## Alternative

You can come up with your own UI to test!
